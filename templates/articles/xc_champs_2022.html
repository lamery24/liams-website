    <h2>NCAA Cross Country Championship Preview</h2>

    <p>On the men’s side there is a clear big four competing for the championship, with the favorites likely being Stanford who are lead by Cole Sprout, Charles Hicks and Ky Robinson. All three of which could easily finish in the top 10. Following Stanford are BYU and Oklahoma State. BYU is led by Junior Casey Clinger, and have a very consistent supporting cast of Brandon Garnica, Joey Nokes, Christian Allen, and Aidan Troutner. Oklahoma State have the home course advantage and their number one runner, senior Alex Maier, is a major threat to win the individual title. Lastly, NAU has been having a disappointing season by their standards. They have been champions in 5/6 past championships; however, they have graduated spectacular talent like Luis Grijalva and Abdihamid Nur in recent years. Despite some of their struggles this season, Sophomore Nico Young, is possibly the best collegiate runner in the country and is favorite to win the meet; Junior Drew Bosley is also a threat to finish within the top 10 this race. In past years NAU has relied on strong finishes by their 3rd-5th runners to lead them to the title, but so far this season those runners have not demonstrated enough to confidently predict them to preform well enough.</p>
<p>The first time these four teams met this season was at the Cowboy Jamboree on September, 24 in Stillwater, OK, where BYU won with a score of 75 after having their top five runners all coming in the top 30. They were followed by Stanford who was missing Ky Robinson but still scored 101, led by Charles Hicks and Cole Sprout who finished second and fourth; however, the lack of depth was the main concern for the Cardinal’s with their 5th runner finishing outside the top 50. NAU and Oklahoma State closely followed Stanford at 110 and 118 points; Oklahoma State’s top 2 Alex Maier and Victor Shitsama went 1-2, and NAU were led by top 10 finishes by Nico Young (5th) and Drew Bosley (9th). The only other time at least 3 of these teams raced each other was at the Nuttycomb invitational at the University of Wisconsin on October 14. Nuttycomb is historically one of the most prestigious and competitive races of the regular season, and one of the only races that is a useful predictor of what might happen at nationals. At Nuttycomb, Stanford got redemption from the Cowboy Jamboree, destroying the field with a team score of 54. BYU was not too far back in 2nd place (89), but NAU had a very disappointing day, finishing in 3rd place with a team score of 145. Once again BYU was very consistent with their top five all finishing between 15th and 21st, but they were no match for a Stanford team which finished 3 runners in the top 10 (Ky Robinson: 1, Charles Hicks: 3, Cole Sprout: 7). NAU was led by Nico Young and Drew Bosley in 2nd and 5th, but their other runners finished much farther back that expected. Following these results, many have been questioning whether or not the dominate force which is NAU can win the national title after winning it 5 of the past 6 years</p>
<p>This past weekend were the regional championships. In the mountain region NAU edged out BYU 43-54. Lead once again by a 1-2 finish for Nico Young and Drew Bosley. While some of the other NAU runners came into stronger form; Ryan Raff, Brodey Hasty, and Santiago Prosser all finished in the top 20. BYU were lead by Brandon Garnica, Casey Clinger, and Joey Nokes in 5th, 6th and 8th place. Meanwhile Oklahoma State finished 2nd (by tiebreaker) in the Midwest Regional Championships, and Stanford easily beat out the likes of Gonzaga, Washington, Oregon, and Portland to claim the West Regional Title, even without Cole Sprout. </p>
    <p>The graph below shows the placing of the teams top runners throughout the important meets of the season. In some of these races, such as the regional championships, teams often run together and don't go all out; however, at races such as Nuttycomb it is clear to see that some of the NAU runners are finishing well below what will be required to win a national championship. Compare this to th consistency of BYU, and it is no wonder that they have dropped in the rankings</p>
        <img id= "img" src = "/static/xc-graph.png">
<p>It is difficult to make cross-country predictions based on a team’s season, many teams rest runners at certain races or treat races that they run as workouts. The regional championships can give us an idea of where each team is at heading into the final and most important meet of the season, but there is still a lot of uncertainty up in the air. Will Stanford’s 4th and 5th runners perform well enough to bring them over the line? How much will racing on their home course elevate Oklahoma State’s performance? How will a Connor Mantz- less BYU team perform? Will their consistency lead them to a title? Will the culture of NAU and Mike Smith’s ability to prepare his team for the right time help them out perform their results from this season? While the championship will most likely be won by one of these four teams, look for teams like Wisconsin, Air Force, and Notre Dame to make a push for the podium.</p>
<p>A tantalizing race for the individual crown is also taking shape. Nico Young was the favorite coming into this season, as the top returning performer from the NCAA 5k championships in the spring of last year; however, he has shown vulnerability this season after being outkicked by Ky Robinson at Nuttycomb. Stanford’s top 3, Robinson, Sprout, and Hicks are all in contention for the title as well. Alex Maier has not been talked about as much as some of the other top runners, but he has quietly been having a rally solid season, and racing on his home course may give him an advantage when it comes to race strategy. Other runners in contention include Casey Clinger (BYU), Victor Kiprop (Alabama), Bob Liking (Wisconsin), Drew Bosley (NAU), Dylan Jacobs (Tennessee), and Carter Solomon (Notre Dame).</p>
<p>Despite these projections, anything can happen in cross-country so make sure to tune in live on Saturday, November 19 at 10 AM EST to catch all the action!
